# Xtreme Weather Prediction




## Overview
The aim is to predict the 14-day average of maximum and minimum temperatures for various US locations, using historical weather data. This project supports community preparedness against extreme weather from climate change.

## Data
The dataset includes temperature, wind speed, and vapor pressure across multiple US locations. Each record represents a unique location and a two-week period, designed to challenge our predictive modeling techniques.

## Goals and Workflow
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Understand data distributions and relationships.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, handle missing values, and detect outliers.
- **Feature Engineering:** Identify and select impactful features for the models.
- **Model Development:** Use machine learning methods like Random Forest, XGBoost, and CNNs.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compare model performances and select the best.
- **Deployment Preparation:** Ready the final model for real-time forecasting applications.

## Challenges
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most relevant features for accurate predictions.
- **Data Merging and Preprocessing:** Effectively combining and preparing datasets for modeling.
